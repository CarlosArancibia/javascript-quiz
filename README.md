# ðŸ§  JavaScript Quiz

**JavaScript Quiz** is an interactive application built with **React + Vite**, written in **TypeScript**, and using **Zustand** for global state management. The main goal of this project is to test your JavaScript knowledge through a multiple-choice question system.  
I built it as a practice project, inspired by a video from Midudev.
